# Basket-Ball-Unity
<p>
This is a application made to flick the ball on the flick gesture. <br>
To check this application one must use Unity Remote 5. <br>

<h2>Summary </h2>
<p>
In this project I have tried to flick the ball with a swipe gesture for touch screen and also tried to give it a projectile motion so that the ball lifts up and then goes into the basket, just like in real life. <br>
Hope you like it.
